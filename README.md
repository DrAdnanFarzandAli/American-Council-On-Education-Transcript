## FIBAA TRANSCRIPT LEGEND 
This transcript contains credentials certified by FIBAA – Foundation for International Business Administration 
Accreditation. The following policies apply only to FIBAA certified credentials within the transcript. FIBAA 
certifications support the recognition of prior learning by validating formal learning experiences gained outside 
European Higher Education Institutions against academic standards in the European Higher Education Area (EHEA), 
thus supporting learners to apply for and gain recognition of ECTS (European Credit Transfer System) credits when 
entering an academic programme in Europe. 

FIBAA (Foundation for International Business Administration Accreditation) is a European quality assurance agency 
for higher education and continuing education programmes. Founded in 1994, FIBAA is registered as an accreditation 
agency in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and further countries in Europe and abroad. In Europe, FIBAA is a member 
of ENQA (European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education) and of CEENQA (Central and Eastern 
European Network of Quality Assurance) and registered with EQAR (European Quality Assurance Register for Higher 
Education). On a trans-European level, FIBAA is member of INQAAHE (International Network for Quality Assurance 
Agencies in Higher Education) and AQAN (ASEAN Quality Assurance Network).
Each FIBAA certification is conducted by a team of experienced university faculty, an expert from professional 
practice and a qualified student. The panel team assesses the content, scope, and rigor of an organization’s 
educational programme against the standards of the ESG (European Standards and Guidelines), the ECTS Users’ 
Guide and the EQF (European Qualification Framework). The panel team makes appropriate recommendations for 
comparable ECTS credits and competencies achieved by students. For more information on processes and standards 
for FIBAA reviews, visit FIBAA: Certification Procedures.
